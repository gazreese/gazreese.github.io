        <p>Clothes Doctor is an online clothes repairs and alterations service, serving the whole of the UK. I came on board to take the over-budget and poor quality website over the finish line.

        <p>Yogassential provides private yoga lessons to homes around the UK. Driven by a customer-facing iOS app and a Ruby on Rails back-end, the service is delivering on its expectations and building its user base. My initial consultancy phase took the
