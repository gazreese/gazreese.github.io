        <p>Yogassential provides private yoga lessons to homes around the UK. Driven by a customer-facing iOS app and a Ruby on Rails back-end, the service is delivering on its expectations and building its user base. My initial consultancy phase took the
            bug-ridden, unfinished and over-budget product to store readiness. After this I took on a CTO role to oversee the ongoing development of the project, transition away from the original developer and drive uptake.
